                    The goal of this website is not to create the most advanced ROI calculator ever,
                    nor was it to create a tool that businesses should rely on.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Instead I simply wanted to create "the tool I need", and with some inspiration from <Link href='https://xkcd.com/1205/' target='_blank'>xkcd </Link>
                    and a session at ESPC by <Link href='https://twitter.com/ChrisO_Brien' target='_blank'>Chris O'Brien</Link> talking about Microsoft Copilot, and the return on investment there.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    I decided to spend a weekend building this little site, that groups together some of the visualization/calculations that I like to use when I'm trying to figure out if a project is worth it.

                    <br />
                    <br />

                    You can edit all the variables that are used in the calculations, on the top right of the page, you'll see a <Icon iconName='settings' />-button, press that and you're off to the races.
