                Hello there ðŸ‘‹
                <br />
                <br />
                <Text variant='large'>Welcome to the ROI Calculator</Text>

                    This is a simple webpage to help you calculate if an investment in your next IT Project is worth it
                    <br />
                    Now full disclosure, I'm not a financial advisor, and I'm not a mathematician, actually I'm an IT consultant.
                    <br />
                    I simply made this out of curiosity and to help my client make better decisions.
                    <br />
                    What really pushed me was the announcement of Microsoft Copilot, and it being priced at USD $30/month/user, and trying to figure out if it was worth it.
                    <br />
                    In the navigation bar you can find a few different pages, that're essentially just different ways of seeing the ROI.
                    <br />
                    You can press the settings button in the top right corner to change the base values, such as how many days you work a year, and how many hours you work a day.
                    <br />
                    Hope you find it useful ðŸ™Œ
                    <br />
